## Abstract
We were tasked with a un-complete project called What's Cookin' that display's available recipes, pantry contents, a shopping list and more. 

With each page refresh, a new random user see's a selection of recipes cards they can choose from. They can interact by saving the recipe to "Meals to Cook" or add a recipe to their favorites list. A user may not have all the ingredients for a given recipe, so when they click the add button on a recipe card, the missing ingredients are added to their shopping list. 

## In Action
Below is the home page for What's Cookin'. Here the user is greeted and the available recipe cards are displayed.

As shown below, the user can view a recipe by clicking on it. They can see their pantry contents and a shopping list. Adding meals will add ingredients to their shopping list. A user can buy the shopping ingredients and also add meals to their favorites.

## Learning Goals
- Our goal was too fix preexisting bugs and add in missing functionality. 
- Make a fully working application using API's
- Begin writing DOM updates in the respective classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD, and implement Spies.
- Use Fetch commands to get and post data from server.
- Use SASS styling to make style files easier to interact with
- Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

### Wins
- Gaining greater understanding of interacting with API's
- Furthering practice with TDD, writing a robust testing suite that includes testing spies
- Writing condensed SASS that is easy to read and adjust

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript, ES6
- HTML/CSS
- SASS
- Webpack
- npm/Spies
- Web API's
