# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

Andy- GET, FETCH and POST. How web api's work and how they connect. 
Carly- Same as above, webpack.
Alex- Get better at refactoring code (looking for redundancies and stuff that doesn't follow SRP).

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

Andy- Paired programming, divide and conquer can be useful too. 
Carly- Divide and conquer is good to go through the struggles in order to learn. Paired programming is helpful in order to solve problems, different perspectives. 
Alex- Open to do both collaboration styles, harder and more important issues should be handled as a team so everyone knows what it does and how it's doing it. 

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

Andy- Verbal communication over written communication for the sake of clarity. 
Carly- Over communicate, better than not enough communication.
Alex- Consistent communication. 

* How would you describe your work style?

Andy- Hard working while on the project, able to take breaks and walk from it. Prefer not to work late past 9. 
Carly- Organized, flexibility with other styles.
Alex- Break things into managable chunks so that it is easier to accomplish.

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

Andy- Technically and logically strong with iterators.
Carly- Thorough and organized. 
Alex- Done this project before, so I know what to expect. Although it is still going to be a little different, shouldn't be a lot of big surprises. 

* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

Carly- Working too late in the night, did not develop good code because of that.
Andy- Not taking breaks, impacts the outcome.
Alex- Trying to do too much at once and getting burnt out. 

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

- Pair programming and using tuple makes us all on the same page. Overcommunication is key to make sure everyone is on the same page moving forward with decisions. 

* How will we overcome obstacles?

- Reach out to others (mentors, rocks, other classmates). Take a pom if we are running into issues that last more than an hour. 

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

- Quiet environment, limit distractions. 

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

- Do not code after 8pm, 4pm break for at least an hour.
Alex- pebble talk at 4:30 on Thursday.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Andy- Verbal feedback is best, written communication can be vague. Work on giving constructive advice that does not come off negative.
Carly- Being kind yet direct with feedback. 
Alex- Don't be afraid to give me direct feedback. 

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

Trello for the project, tuple for paired coding, github, slack for messaging. 

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

- Reach out, send screenshots, provide as much context. Knowing when it's best to tackle issues as a team, or try to divide and conquer. 

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

- If you learn what you wanted to learn. Feel good about what you accomplished. Having time at the end to go back and clean things up. 

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

- Virtual pats on the back.
